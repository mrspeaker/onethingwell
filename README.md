# OneThingWell

A huge collection of tiny utilities, by @mrspeaker

## The idea

The idea is to have a page of absolute chaos (think [Ling Cars](http://www.lingscars.com/)) with zillions of little widgets that all do one thing... the antithesis of the almost completly blank website with a giant font - doing just one thing.

It won't be any interesting until there's zillions. So... slowly slowly catcy monkey.

## Goals

- Small widgets: avoid anything that takes up much space.
- Minimal load: some things will require lots of info to load... all async/lazy
- Responsive design: including font-sizes - so if you have a big screen it still looks crazy, just with bigger fonts.
- Minimal blank areas: so a simple `float:left` isn't going to cut it.

## ToDO: add gaetan's number picker
